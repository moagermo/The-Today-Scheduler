# The-Today-Scheduler

## Description 

Most of us need a reliable calendar to keep track of our daily responsibilities. This scheduler will show you what tasks you need to do during the chosen day. The date is displayed at the top and the hour blocks will change depending on the time.

## Usage 

The site will load timeslots in a color-coded fashion that shows in gray the hours in the past, red for the current hour and green for the hours in the future. This will allow you to easily see which tasks you have for the rest of the day. Once you have typed in your task, you can hit "Save" and your task will be saved.
